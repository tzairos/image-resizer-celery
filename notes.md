# Celeris

Celery is a simple, flexible, and reliable distributed system to process vast amounts of messages, while providing operations with the tools required to maintain such a system.

Itâ€™s a task queue with focus on real-time processing, while also supporting task scheduling.

Task queues are used as a mechanism to distribute work across threads or machines.

It adds an abstraction to the jobs related with Message Brokers.
